    <h1>Test piosenki</h1>
        <p>I wake up to the sounds<br>Of the silence that allows<br>For my mind to run around<br>With my ear up to the ground
            <br>I'm searching to behold<br>The stories that are told<br>When my back is to the world<br>
            <br>That was smilin' when I turned<br>Tell you "you're the greatest"<br>But once you turn, they hate us
            <br>Oh, the misery<br>Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
        </p>
